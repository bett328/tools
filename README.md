Tools for Analysis
Welcome to the Tools for Analysis project repository! In this project, I have conducted a detailed cohort analysis to understand user behavior and trends over time.

Project Overview
Cohort analysis is a powerful technique used in data analysis to understand user behavior and performance metrics based on their interaction with a product or service. By organizing users into cohorts based on a common characteristic or time period, we can gain insights into how different groups of users behave and evolve over time.

Project Highlights - Cohort analysis:
Data Preprocessing: The data underwent preprocessing steps such as date extraction and cohort assignment to categorize users into their respective cohorts.
Cohort Matrix Creation: Using the cohort information, I constructed matrices to visualize retention rates and purchase behaviors over time.
Heatmap Visualization: The retention and purchase matrices were visualized using heatmaps to easily spot trends and patterns.
Insights Generation: The analysis revealed insights about user retention, purchase trends, and the performance of different cohorts.
LinkedIn Post: Check out my LinkedIn post to get a quick overview of the project and its findings.

How to Use
Clone: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Data: Replace the sample data with your dataset, ensuring it has columns for user IDs, dates, and purchase amounts.
Run Code: Navigate through the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see how the analysis was performed.
Visualizations: Observe the heatmap visualizations to understand the retention and purchase patterns.
Adapt and Share: Modify the code to fit your specific dataset and use case. Feel free to share your insights and findings with the community.
